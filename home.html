                    Racial discrimination refers to the act of treating individuals or groups in an unequal 
                    or isolated way due to their race or ethnicity. Prejudice, bias, and unfair treatment may 
                    arise from racial or ethnic characteristics including skin tone, ancestry, cultural practices, 
                    or country of origin. Learn how to make society a safer place by preventing racial discrimination.

                <p class="homepara2">
                    According to the most recent data available, nearly one in six persons worldwide report having experienced 
                    discrimination on any basis. Racial discrimination based on characteristics like race, color, or language is
                     one of the most common forms of discrimination against both men and women. Though it is somewhat less common, 
                     discrimination based on age and religion also almost equally affects men and women.

                <p class="homepara">
                    Discrimination may limit an individual's access to high-quality education, opportunities for employment, and career 
                    progression, which may worsen cycles of poverty and inequality. Significant psychological pain, such as emotions of
                     rage, grief, worry, and low self-esteem, can result from racial prejudice. Hence, discrimination can cause relationships
                      between individuals to be damaged, which can result in mistrust, conflict, and destroyed connections with others. 
                      Additionally, it may help to maintain assumptions and stereotypes, which in response may strengthen prejudiced 
                      opinions and behaviors.
