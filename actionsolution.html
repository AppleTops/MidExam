            <h1 class = "titlepara"> Talking about Race</h1><br><br>
            <p class="para">It's important to talk to your staff about appropriate language to use when discussing race. 
                This includes when you're speaking with individual staff members and in wider work communications. 
                Establish the tone for a polite and transparent conversation. Make sure that nobody is afraid to voice 
                their opinions or worries for fear of being judged. Provide examples of improper language along with any 
                possible consequences. Provide examples of how specific words or phrases could worsen stereotypes, restrict
                 people, or create a hostile work environment.
                 <br><br>
                 You should make it clear that racist language is not acceptable, including things some might consider as 'banter' 
                 or jokes. You should also be sensitive in the terms you use around race and ethnicity. Common terms include:
                        <br><br>
                 -BAME (black, Asian and minority ethnic)<br>
                 -BME (black and minority ethnic)<br>
                 -ethnic minorities<br>
                 -minority ethnic<br>
                 -people of color<br><br>
           
                    Each of these terms can be problematic and there's no one term that everyone will prefer. 
                    Talk to your staff about how they feel about these terms. Language and preferences can also change over time. 
                    People can sometimes cause offense by using the 'wrong' language. If they have not done it maliciously, talking
                     to them about what's appropriate can sometimes be all that's needed. It's important not to excuse deliberately 
                     offensive behavior in this way.

            <p class="para">A lot of social media platforms aim to make their sites secure and empowering for users from every aspect of 
                life. Report any content you come across that you believe goes against the platform's policies. Discrimination and 
                racism harm people and communities by promoting inequality. You may help create a more secure and welcoming online 
                community where people of all racial, ethnic, gender, and other identities feel appreciated and cherished by reporting 
                offensive information.
                 <br><br><br>
                 You may help create a supportive online community built on empathy, understanding, and respect for others by speaking out 
                 against racism and discrimination. This discourages negative conduct and promotes positive communication and teamwork. It's 
                 important to report racist or discriminatory content on the internet in order to promote inclusivity, safeguard vulnerable 
                 populations, stop hate speech from becoming the norm, enforce platform regulations, maintain legal compliance, create a 
                 supportive online community, and give victims more power.

        <p class="para">
            United Nations Children's Fund, is actively involved in fighting discrimination around the world, particularly concerning 
            children's rights. UNICEF advocates for rules and regulations that promote equality and diversity while bringing attention
             to the negative effects of prejudice on children. In addition to helping you spread peace, your support of them will benefit
              UNICEF, which funds educational initiatives that instill in kids and adults the value of tolerance, diversity, and respect 
              for the rights of others. UNICEF's work in promoting equality and diversity contributes to peacebuilding efforts by addressing
               root causes of conflict and promoting social cohesion. By fostering inclusive societies where all children have equal 
               opportunities to thrive, UNICEF helps to create a foundation for lasting peace and stability.
             <br><br><br>
             They additionally collaborate with communities to address the fundamental beliefs and social norms that support prejudice. This 
             involves working together to advance mutual respect and compassion with community, religious, and educational leaders. To learn 
             more about the rates, causes, and effects of discrimination against children, they gather data on the subject. UNICEF makes sure
              that children who are impacted by catastrophes are shielded from prejudice and given the assistance they require to get 
              well and start over in life. UNICEF aims to create a world where every child can grow up free from discrimination, with equal 
              opportunities to thrive and fulfill their potential.

        <h1 class = "titlepara"> CHALLENGE EVERYDAY DISCRIMINATION <br>AND RACISM  </h1><br><br><br>
        <p class="para">
            We frequently encounter bigotry and xenophobia in our daily lives. It can often take shape in the form of jokes, stereotypes, 
            or hurtful remarks and inquiries from our friends, relatives, or coworkers. If you feel comfortable talking to a friend or 
            family member you have seen speaking racist or discriminatory words, you should do so. First, speak with them one-on-one or by 
            direct message in private. By dealing with the matter in private, the person may maintain their dignity and lessen the 
            possibility that they will experience embarrassment or humiliation in public. Talking enables both people to communicate their 
            ideas and emotions without the pressure of a group of people, which can result in a deeper exchange of viewpoints.
             <br><br><br>
             Point out to them that what they are saying is racist or discriminatory and remind them that everyone has the right to dignity
              and that in many countries it is against the law to discriminate against a person because of the color of their skin, their
               ethnicity, religion, gender or sexual orientation. Offer content that you have found useful with them and encourage them to 
               learn more about the historical background of racial prejudice and discrimination. Privately discussing racism or 
               discrimination with someone can increase trust and improve your relationship. It lays the foundation for future discussions 
               and cooperation by demonstrating your dedication to truthfulness, morality, and respect for others.

        <p class="para">
            Pay attention to friends, neighbors, students, and local authorities who are speaking out against racism on a daily basis. 
            Discuss racial discrimination in an honest and open manner with friends, family, coworkers, and people of the community. 
            In a kind and helpful way, hear their points of view, offer your own experiences, and debunk misconceptions. Think about 
            your own privileges, biases, and behaviors. Additionally, think about how you may help reduce racial discriminatory systems. 
            Participate in collaboration programs, and give support to advocacy efforts, and raise the voices of underrepresented 
            communities to make a difference.
             <br><br><br>
             There are also a lot of articles, books, documentaries, films and podcasts on issues of racism, discrimination and privilege. 
             There are books and articles written by experts and individuals with lived experiences of racial discrimination. Look for 
             literature that covers the history of racism, its impact on society, and strategies for fighting it. To keep up with the most 
             recent news on racial discrimination and social justice issues, follow activists, scholars, and organizations on social media 
             sites like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Listen to what the people in them have to say. Understand and confront your own 
             privilege. Be prepared to feel uncomfortable at times. Many of us absorb biases and prejudices at an early age, so they are 
             not easy to unlearn.
